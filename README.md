## Description

Ever wondered what it would look like to see all your in Health recorded workouts on one map at once?
Or ever wondered which are the routes you took most during your workouts?
Workout Map will help you with exactly that!

- Display all your recorded workout routes in one map
- See the heat map of your routes
- Optionally set different colors for each activity type
- Filter on activity types and date ranges if you only want certain routes on the map
- Use predefined filter for faster access to certain time ranges
- Share and save your training routes on a map image or chose your own image or a color as a background. Also optional show the workout statistics
- Your routes on top of a neutral background allow sharing your training routes in a more private way

Workout Map works with the routes you saved to the Health app.
You can record your trainings and routes with the AppleWatch or other apps on your iPhone.

Routes will be displayed in a simplified version, which will allow Workout Map to work with more routes on the map.


Privacy is especially imported with health data. So all your data stays on your device. All analyses stay on your device and will not be transferred anywhere.
Workout Map will cache the simplified version of your routes on your device for faster access. You can delete this cached data any time inside the app.
