## Description

Ever wondered what it would look like to see all your recorded workouts with Apple Watch on one map at once?
Or ever wondered which are the routes you took most during your workouts?
Workout Map will help you with exactly that!

- Display all your recorded workout routes in one map
- See the heat map of your routes
- Optionally set different colors for each activity type
- Filter on activity types and date ranges if you only want certain routes on the map

Workout Map works with the routes you saved to the Health app.
Routes will be displayed in a simplified version, which will allow Workout Map to work with a lot of routes on the map.


Privacy is especially imported with health data. So all your data stays on your device. All analyses stay on your device and will not be transferred anywhere.
